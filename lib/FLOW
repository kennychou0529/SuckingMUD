At bootup, the driver loads master.c, then simul_efun.c.

Once loaded, the function epilog() is called.
For each filename returned, the driver called preload(), passing
the filename as an argument.

Finally, when a user connects to the main port, the function
connect() is called.  If it returns an object, that objects
is marked as interactive, and the function logon() is called
in it.
